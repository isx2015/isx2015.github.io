## Recently updated:
[Algebra(Artin) Chapter 1](algebra_chap1.html)

[Undergraduate Maths Project](ug_maths_project.html)
## Aims:

To **collect** and **share** what I have learnt.

This includes but not limited to subjects such as:
* **Maths**
* **Physics**
* Computer
* Programming

In the forms of:
* Introducing selected topics in details
* Worked solutions to textbooks with no official answer
* Analysing subtle problems
* Explaining **why**

As I'm a physics university student, the content will predominantly focus on Maths and Physics.
